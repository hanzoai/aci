This repository contains the Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) for Hanzo, providing essential tools and interfaces for AI agents to interact with computer systems for software development tasks. The core functionality is implemented in Python and includes code editing, linting, and utility functions.

## General Setup:

Before pushing any changes, ensure all checks pass:
* Run pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run --files hanzo_aci/**/* tests/**/* --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml`
* Run tests: `poetry run pytest`

The pre-commit hooks include:
- Code formatting with Ruff
- Type checking with MyPy
- YAML validation
- Trailing whitespace and EOF fixes
- pyproject.toml validation and formatting
